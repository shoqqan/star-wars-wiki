<h2>About the project</h2>

  <p>A <b>Star Wars Wiki</b> website is a website that allows users to expolore the univers of Star Wars. The website provides an easy-to-use interface for exploring planets, characters, films and STARSHIPS!
  
  Star Wars Wiki is connected to the StarWarsAPI, which is a popular source of data for Star Wars information. Star Wars provides data on thousands of films and character, including their information, planets, and other important information. By using this API, the website can provide users with real-time information about the Star Wars universe.
  </p>

  <br>

Goals 👉 Create a separate wiki on the internet for the Star Wars fans and guys who interested in Star Wars.</p>
Tasks ✔️ Release the Wiki Website for fans and interested people, where users can explore and check information about their favorite characters.</p>

 Website language: </p>
<b>English</b> </p>
 <br>
<p>During development, i chose a <b>feature-sliced design</b> architecture in React because the each architectural component has its purpose and predictable dependencies.
This keeps a balance between following the DRY principle and adaptation possibilities.</p>
<br>
<p>So we have several reasons why i use <b>Effector</b> instead of Redux</p>
<ul>
  <li>A slided stores better then monolit store</li>
  <li>Highly optimised</li>
  <li>Reactive programming</li>
  <li>Out-of-box TypeScript support</li>
</ul>
